US-001: As a Billing Officer, I want the system to automatically reconcile payments to invoices so that I can focus only on exceptions.

Acceptance criteria:
- Given daily billing and payments files, when the reconciliation runs, then matched invoices are closed and exceptions are listed.
- Match rate >= 95% on day 1 for standard invoices.
